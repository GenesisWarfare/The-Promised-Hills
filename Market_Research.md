# Market Research – *The Promised Hills*

## 1. Market Overview
The global strategy games market was valued at ~$18 billion in 2024, projected to reach $35 billion by 2033.  
The tower defense subgenre — smaller but loyal — is growing from $4.7B → $9.7B by 2033.  

Tower defense games are nearly non existent in the Israeli market.

### Key Market Trends

- AI-assisted balancing and personalization
- Rising interest in historically grounded indie titles

## 2. Target Audience

### Demographics
- Ages **16–45**, predominantly male

-  Educators/Students – use games for learning

### Israel-Specific
- Local gaming market: **$582M (2024)** → **$768M (2027)**  
- Strategy and educational games are among the top-performing genres  
- Global diaspora market offers additional reach and cultural appeal  


## 3. Competitive Landscape

| Game | Genre | Key Takeaway |
|------|--------|--------------|
| **Age of War / Army of Ages** | Simplified historical tower defense | Era-based progression works well |

The Promised Hills fills this niche with simple strategy gameplay.
