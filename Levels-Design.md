# 📘 The Promised Hills – Level Design Document  
### Lead your settlement through Israel’s history — one battle at a time


# 1. Game Flow Overview

## 1.1 Start Menu
When launching the game, the player sees:

- Start button  
- Settings  
- Credits

Starting the game opens the Era Selection Screen.


## 1.2 Era Structure
The game contains 4 eras, each representing a historical period:

1. Kingdom of Israel
2. Kingdom of Judah
3. Hasmonean Revolt
4. Modern State of Israel

Each era contains several battles shown as red markers on a map of Israel.  
To unlock Era N+1, the player must finish all battles of Era N.

# 2. Gameplay Structure (All Eras)

Each battle loads a side-scrolling battlefield (similar to Age of War) in 2D.

The player must:

- Fight waves of enemies  
- Destroy the enemy base to win  

Enemies drop gold, used to purchase:

- Units  
- Base defenses  
- Extra build slots (additional platforms) fore defenses

Each era features unique units, enemies, backgrounds, and buildings.

The units appear instantly on the player’s base after buy them.

They automatically advance towards the enemy base.

The units compete according to their stats (damage, range...).

If the units reach the enemy base they attack it.

With the advancement of levels, a gap widens between the power of the enemy soldiers and that of the player, and the enemy becomes more strategic (for example by better organizing their choice of unit to send, in which order...)

The number of hp, speed, and damage change depending on the units and eras.
